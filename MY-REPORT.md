# Research Question

How can we effectively apply Prompt Engineering techniques to automate and enhance requirement analysis processes?

## Arguments

#### What is already known about this topic

* Prompt Engineering can structure model outputs for more consistent results.  
* Well-targeted prompts reduce hallucinations and improve requirement clarity.  
* Techniques like Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, and Chain-of-Thought have proven effective for many use cases.

#### What this research is exploring

* We apply multiple Prompt Engineering methodologies to systematically extract requirements from broad inputs.  
* We compare how different prompting strategies perform in capturing functional and non-functional requirements.  
* We analyze the limitations and performance trade-offs across various methods.

#### Implications for practice

* More comprehensive and efficient requirement analysis, reducing human overhead.  
* Potential for automated documentation and reporting of software requirements.  
* A framework for systematically testing prompt variations for higher accuracy.

# Research Method

1. **Select Use Cases**: E-commerce, mobile applications, and enterprise systems.  
2. **Apply Prompting Techniques**: Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, Chain-of-Thought, Self-Ask, etc.  
3. **Evaluation Metrics**: Relevance, completeness, consistency, and user satisfaction.  
4. **Iterate**: Refine prompts, measure improvement, and document best practices.

# Results

* **Improved Completeness**: Techniques like Devilâ€™s Advocate Prompting and Role-Based Prompting highlight hidden requirements.  
* **Reduced Ambiguity**: Chain-of-Thought and Self-Ask approaches clarify unclear or missing details in user stories.  
* **Faster Documentation**: Automated generation of requirement checklists and summaries saves time for product teams.

# Further Research

* Investigate multi-level or meta-prompting workflows to automate the entire SDLC requirement phase.  
* Compare performance across different large language models with the same prompting strategies.  
* Explore advanced metrics (e.g., recall, precision) for measuring how comprehensive the extracted requirements are.
