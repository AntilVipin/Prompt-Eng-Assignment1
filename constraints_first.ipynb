    "# Constraints-First Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints-First Prompting explicitly front-loads real-world limitations (such as budget, technical, regulatory, or timeline constraints) into the prompt so that the model tailors its solution or analysis around these boundaries. By highlighting constraints early, it ensures alignment with practical considerations and reduces unrealistic outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Idea\n",
    "1.\tEarly Limitations: Present budget, legal, or technical constraints upfront to guide the modelâ€™s reasoning.\n",
    "2.\tFeasibility Over Ideals: The model focuses on practical, implementable solutions rather than idealized but unattainable ideas.\n",
    "3.\tReduced Redundancies: Prevents time wasted on proposals that exceed project scope or violate mandatory regulations.\n",
