    "# Role-Based Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Role-Based Prompting casts the model into specific roles or personas (e.g., a “Business Analyst,” “Technical Architect,” “QA Engineer”). This helps the model frame its answers from diverse perspectives, ensuring well-rounded analyses or solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Idea\n",
    "1.\t**Targeted Perspective:** By giving the model a “role,” you direct its style and scope of reasoning.\n",
    "2.\t**Domain Expertise Simulation:** The LLM mimics a domain specialist’s thought process.\n",
    "3.\t**Multi-Role Collaboration:** Using multiple roles can capture conflicting priorities or needs (business vs. technical vs. user).\n",
