    "# Self-Ask Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Self-Ask Prompting instructs the model to generate its own questions about a user query, then answer those questions, and finally produce a consolidated response. This approach systematically surfaces hidden assumptions and clarifications, improving thoroughness.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Idea\n",
    "1. **Self-Questioning:** The LLM proposes sub-questions it deems necessary to clarify the main query.\n",
    "2. **Self-Resolution:** It answers its own questions using its knowledge base.\n",
    "3. **Comprehensive Response:** The final output is more detailed, covering potential uncertainties or ambiguities.\n",

      "5. How will inventory management work for custom-tailored items? Will they be pre-made or ordered as needed?\n",

      "1. Customization options may include size (e.g., XS-L), color, style, and possibly other details like fabric content or embroidery.\n",
      "2. Customers will likely select their desired outfit components using a filter-based system with dropdowns for size, color, and style options.\n",
      "3. Fabric restrictions may be based on customer preferences for sustainability, veganism, or specific materials used in the garment (e.g., organic cotton).\n",
      "4. Garment styles that need to be supported include workwear, formal wear, as well as possibly some casual and activewear styles.\n",
      "5. Inventory management will likely involve a system where custom orders are created and stored until production, then shipped out when ready. Some orders might be pre-made to meet demand or for rush orders.\n",
      "6. The expected turnaround time for creating and shipping custom orders is typically between 7-14 business days, depending on the complexity of the design and materials used.\n",
      "7. Pricing models may include tiered pricing based on complexity (e.g., more complex designs with more details) and the types of materials used (e.g., premium fabrics).\n",
