    "# Brainstorm Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Brainstorm Prompting guides the model to generate a wide range of ideas or options before converging on a final answer. It is particularly useful for creative or open-ended tasks, such as design thinking or solution ideation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Idea\n",
    "1.\t**Idea Generation:** The model is explicitly told to list multiple possibilities without judgment.\n",
    "2.\t**Encourage Novelty:** Often uses higher temperature or specific wording (“Generate 10 ideas…”).\n",
    "3.\t**Later Filtering:** After brainstorming, you can refine or filter results for feasibility or relevance.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Offline Data Preprocessing**: Store translated data locally on the device, allowing users to access translations even without an internet connection.\n",
      "2. **Real-time Contextual Translation**: Use AI-powered machine learning algorithms to understand the context of the conversation and provide more accurate translations in real-time.\n",
      "3. **Voice Assistant Integration**: Allow users to trigger voice-to-translation functionality with voice commands, making it easier to translate conversations hands-free.\n",
      "4. **Multilingual Dictionary**: Provide a comprehensive dictionary of words in multiple languages, allowing users to learn new vocabulary on the go.\n",
      "5. **Offline Maps and Travel Guides**: Offer offline access to maps, travel guides, and cultural information for destinations around the world, helping users navigate unfamiliar places.\n",
      "6. **Language Learning Features**: Incorporate language learning tools, such as verb conjugations, grammar explanations, and speaking exercises, to help users improve their language skills.\n",
      "7. **Offline Messaging and Voice Notes**: Allow users to send messages and record voice notes while offline, ensuring they can stay in touch with friends and family without an internet connection.\n",

      "These features prioritize user experience, accessibility, and practicality\n",
