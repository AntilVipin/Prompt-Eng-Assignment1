    "# Diagram-Assist Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Diagram-Assist Prompting instructs a language model to produce a text-based representation of system components, data flows, or user journeys. While the output is not a graphical image, the ASCII-like diagrams or structured outlines generated can help clarify complex architectures and processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Idea\n",
    "1.\tStructured Visualization: The prompt directs the model to depict relationships or workflows using text-based diagrams or bulleted outlines.\n",
    "2.\tClarity & Collaboration: Diagrammatic prompts help stakeholders collaborate without requiring specialized drawing toolsâ€”everyone can interpret or modify text-based diagrams.\n",
    "3.\tIntegration with Requirements: As part of requirement analysis or design brainstorming, Diagram-Assist Prompting can help capture architecture or system interactions more intuitively.\n",
